# To run on your local machine

Required: 

 node.js || v6.0.0+ type "$ node --version" in your bash terminal to see if node is installed and to check the version

<br />
 
 mongodb || If you dont already have mongo db installed on your local machine you will need to install it as this appplication uses it: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

In node Terminal:

	 > $ git clone git@github.com:joemulick/Saint-Paschal-Baylon-Church.git

	 > $ cd saint-paschal-baylon-church

	 > $ npm i

	 > $ cd client

	 > $ npm i


In order for for this application to work you need to run three seperate servers (bash terminals) simultaneously; One for mongodb, one for the backend (server) and one for the front end (react).

Once you have mongo db installed locally start it up with (you can start it up from any file directry it does not matter):

	> $ mongod

Go back one file directory and start the node.js server using:

	> $ cd ..
	

	> $ PORT=3001 node bin/www (at this point you should be starting the backened server from the outer directory with app.js)

Once the node.js server is running, open a new bash window inside saint-paschal-baylon-church/client (client directory) and start the create-react-app server with:

	> $ npm start

You're holier already!
